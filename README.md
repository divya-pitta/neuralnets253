# neuralnets253

This repository is organized as follows:

LinearModels : contains basic linear models for classification of MNIST. 

BackPropagation_ScratchImplementation : an implementation of gradient descent from scratch in Python for a single and double hidden layer fully connected feed forward neural network for classification of MNIST images.

CNN: Experiments with different CNN architectures for classification of CIFAR-10 dataset. Also used a pre-trained VGG-net to classify Caltech-256 dataset.

RNN: Music generation experiments with different RNN models trained on MIDI files.
